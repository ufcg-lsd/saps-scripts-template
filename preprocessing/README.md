./run.sh input_path output_path metadata_path
```

- `input_path` is the path to the directory containing the data downloaded by Inputdownload phase;
- `output_path` is the path to the directory in which the preprocessed data will be stored;
- `metadata_path` is the path of the metadata directory of the Preprocessing phase.

# Exit code
